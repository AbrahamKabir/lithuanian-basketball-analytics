Basketball holds a special place in the hearts of Lithuanians, and EuroBasket is one of the most cherished tournaments. As part of my application to Vilnius University, I wanted to create a project that reflects my appreciation for basketball and showcases my technical skills. The EuroBasket Stats Viewer is a Python script designed to fetch and display live game information and team statistics for the EuroBasket 2025 tournament. It displays the current scoreboard, including team names, scores, remaining time, and the current game period and also lists teams based on their average points scored per game.

The project was built around the idea of interacting with a live API. However, due to the unavailability of a valid API endpoint for EuroBasket 2025, I used a placeholder API structure to simulate the data fetching process. 

This project is more than just code; it's a reflection of my enthusiasm for basketball and my dedication to learning. Lithuania's passion for basketball inspired me to create a meaningful project that aligns with the culture and spirit of the country.
